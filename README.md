<b>TASK:</b>

Assignment 1
: Predict the price of a house
Dataset: <DS - Assignment Part 1 data set.xlsx>
Link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aypq6h3254207bs/AACzMLvo-XtK9sYAAma6FW0la?dl=0
Problem statement: The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these
variables affect the house price.
Using more than one model, predict the price of the house using the given dataset. Please compare the
accuracy of the models along with the drawbacks of each technique's assumptions before recommending
the final prediction model.

Assignment 2
: Product matching
Attached is sample product lists from Flipkart & Amazon
<DS - Assignment Part 2 data set.zip>
Link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/aypq6h3254207bs/AACzMLvo-XtK9sYAAma6FW0la?dl=0
Problem statement:
Using ML/DL techniques, match similar products from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset. Once
similar products are matched, display the retail price from FK and AMZ side by side. Please explore as
many techniques as possible before choosing the final technique.
You may either display the final result in single table format OR You may create a simple form where we
input the product name and the output of prices of the product from both websites are displayed.

<b>REQUIRED LIBRARIES</b>

1. pandas
2. seaborn
3. numpy
4. scikit-learn
5. re
6. sentence_transformers

<b>User installation<b>

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using `pip`:

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or `conda`:

    conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn

<p>The documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.</p>

## Installation of Sentence Transformers for Task 2: Product Matching

We recommend **Python 3.6** or higher, **[transformers v4.6.0](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)** or higher. The code does **not** work with Python 2.7.

**Install with pip**

Install the *sentence-transformers* with `pip`:

```
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

**Install with conda**

You can install the *sentence-transformers* with `conda`:

```
conda install -c conda-forge sentence-transformers
```

**Install from sources**

Alternatively, you can also clone the latest version from the [repository](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) and install it directly from the source code:

````
pip install -e .
````
